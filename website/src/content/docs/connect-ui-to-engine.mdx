title: Connect the UI to the Engine
description: Point the pompelmi UI components to your running engine.
---

This guide shows how to connect a running `@pompelmi/engine` to the UI components.

## Quick start

```tsx
import { UploadDropzone } from "@pompelmi/ui-react";

export default function Demo() {
  return (
    <UploadDropzone
      engineUrl="http://localhost:8787/scan"
      onResult={(r) => console.log("scan result", r)}
      onError={(e) => console.error(e)}
    />
  );
}
```

- Ensure your engine CORS allows your origin (`CORS_ORIGIN`).
- For multi-file uploads, handle per-file callbacks and aggregate results in your app state.
